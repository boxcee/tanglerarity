# DONE

- [x] Add upload for collections not accessible through Soonaverse

# TODO
- [ ] JSON should support split collections on Soonaverse. E.g. an owner split a collection to reward some NFTs in raffles and some on the open market. Collections are separate on Soonaverse, but should be treated as a single collection when calculating rarity scores
- [ ] Design NFT detail view
- [ ] Design Collection detail view
- [ ] Change design of collection overview to a design similar to the NFT overview
- [ ] Add name filter
- [ ] Add sorting (asc & desc)
